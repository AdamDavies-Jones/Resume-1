    <div id="hobbies"><h1><u>Hobbies and Interests</u></h1>
    <p>I am a passionate baker and love art. Of an evening, I am often to be found engaged in crochet, drawing, or working with clay. 
        <br />
        I also like to travel, and recently visited both New York and the Mediterranean, including several classical and historic sites famous in antiquity. 
        <br />
        An avid video gamer, I particularly like Nintendo games, the Legend of Zelda series most of all, and enjoy reading a wide range of fiction.</p>
